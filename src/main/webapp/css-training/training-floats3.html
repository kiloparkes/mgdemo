 				It’s perfectly possible to float every column, not just the left and right sidebars. You
could float the first sidebar to the left, the middle column to the left, and the right
sidebar to the right, as shown in Figure 12-2, top. This approach lets you put more
than three columns in your design.

 			<p> Notice that the background image for the left side bar is not as long as the main text. It stops short.
 			This is because a box is as long as the containing text unless you specify a height. Therefore, even though
 			we have repeat-y for the image it only goes as far at the height of the containing text. 
 			<strong>The solution</strong> is to wrap the side bar and content and add the image to the
 			wrapper with repeat-y</p>

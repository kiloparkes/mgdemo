April 24, the lowest level since the end of March, from minus 42.6. Measures of 
personal finances and buying climate dropped.
Jobless ClaimsNew applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last
 week to the highest level in three months, a report from the Labor Department
  showed. Unemployment insurance claims jumped by 25,000 to 429,000. The government
   anticipates a drop in unadjusted claims during the week leading up to the Easter 
   holiday, something that didn’t happen this year, a Labor
Department spokesman said.
